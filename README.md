# STM32F407 Ultrasonic Sensor + UART (WIP)

This is a small part of my major project:  
🚗 **CAN-Based Collision Avoidance System**

Right now, I am working on measuring distance using the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** with the **STM32F407VG Discovery Kit** and printing the output on **Minicom** using **UART (USB-TTL)**.

### ✔ Current Progress
The project compiles and runs, UART prints correctly, but the ultrasonic reading is currently: Distance = 0 cm


I am still working on debugging and fixing the sensor reading.

More updates will be pushed as I continue developing this module.
